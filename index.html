        <h1>Free Software Jobs</h1>

<pre>
Why?

I felt the personal need for a job portal for Free Software jobs as
one of my main criterias for any future job is the ability to work with and on FOSS.
The FSF webpage has only a tiny section on "Free Software Jobs" and most existing job portals
are not specialized in Free Software / FOSS (they sometimes have tags such as "open source", but without a clear criteria).

What is a "Free Software Job"?

A "Free Software Job" in the context of this site is any job
where at least 50% of the time contribute to free and open-source software (FOSS).
Contribution does not necessarily involve writing software --- job profiles such as UX, product management, QA and translation for FOSS are equally important.
Working *with* FOSS alone is not enough to satisfy this criteria,
i.e. a Linux administration job in an otherwise proprietary environment does not fit.


Is a fee involved for posting a job offer?

No. I believe there should be no barriers for posting Free Software Jobs.
