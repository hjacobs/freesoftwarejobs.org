        <h1>Free Software Jobs</h1>
        <p>This site is under construction and will host a portal for Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) jobs, see <a href="https://github.com/hjacobs/freesoftwarejobs.org">https://github.com/hjacobs/freesoftwarejobs.org</a></p>

        <h3>Why?</h3>

        <p>I felt the personal need for a job portal for Free Software jobs as
one of my main criteria for any future job is the ability to work with and on FOSS.
The FSF webpage has only a <a href="https://www.fsf.org/resources/jobs/">tiny section on "Free Software Jobs"</a> and most existing job portals
are not specialized in Free Software / FOSS (they sometimes have tags such as "open source", but without a clear criteria).</p>

        <h3>What is a "Free Software Job"?</h3>

        <p>A "Free Software Job" in the context of this site is any job
        where at least 50% of the time contribute to <a href="https://fsfe.org/about/basics/freesoftware.en.html">Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS)</a>.
Contribution does not necessarily involve writing software --- job profiles such as UX, product management, QA and translation for FOSS are equally important.
Working *with* FOSS alone is not enough to satisfy this criteria,
i.e. a Linux administration job in an otherwise proprietary environment does not fit.</p>


        <h3>Is a fee involved for posting a job offer?</h3>

        <p>No. I believe there should be no barriers for posting Free Software Jobs. The FSF charges a fee and I suppose that's one reason their page lists only very few jobs.</p>
